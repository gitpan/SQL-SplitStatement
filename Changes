Revision history for SQL-SplitStatement

0.01002 2010-05-28 20:30:00 CET

 * Removed "use DBI" from some tests, which was left there for error (and caused
   said tests to fail, where DBI is not installed).

 * Minor POD enhancements.

0.01001 2010-05-28 19:00:00 CET

 * Added the ability to discard/keep comments.
   Really, this is a change in the API, since now comments are discarded
   by default, while before they were returned instead.
   I hope that this won't harm any user, given the young age of this module
   (furthermore there isn't any difference when feeding the returned statements
   to a DBMS, the differences are just /cosmetic/).
   Sorry anyway!

 * Added tests for this.

0.01000 2010-05-27 08:00:00 CET

 * Initial release.
