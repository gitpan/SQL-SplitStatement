 * Removed "use DBI" from some tests, which was left there for error (and caused
   said tests to fail, where DBI was not installed).
 
 * Minor docs enhancements.

0.01001 2010-05-28 19:00:00 CET

 * Added the ability to discard/keep comments.
   Really, this is a change in the API, since now comments are discarded by
   default, while before they were returned instead.
   I hope that this won't harm any user, given the young age of this module
   (furthermore there isn't any difference when feeding the returned statements
   to a DBMS, the differences are just /cosmetic/).
   Sorry anyway!
 
 * Added tests and docs for this.

0.01000 2010-05-27 08:00:00 CET
